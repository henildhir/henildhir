## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am **Henil Dhirajlal**.

I am a university student currently studying at **Queen Mary University of London**. 

A few hobbies that I do is watch Formula 1, karting, play a ton of sports like football, cricket and badminton. I also love to do bhangra, a punjabi folk dance that is taught by students and teachers at the university.

I have limited ability to code, however I do want to improve my coding skills within Java, Python and other programming languages.
